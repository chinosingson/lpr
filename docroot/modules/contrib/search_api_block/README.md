# Search API block

The Search API Block module provides a simple block in order to show a
search input anywhere in your website.

The search module from core provides a similar block but since Search API
is not compatible with the search module from core, this module adds this
block for Search API.

For a full description of the module, visit the
[project page](https://www.drupal.org/project/search_api_block).
